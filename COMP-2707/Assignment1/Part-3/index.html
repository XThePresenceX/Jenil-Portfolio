      I intend to improve my knowledge in the web development dapartment, which
      includes familiarizing myself with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and
      improving my fluency among them. I would also want to get used to using
      frameworks based of these languages and mainly want to become fluent
      enough that I can troubleshoot and understand most errors and why are they
      happening. Recently I learned to make website responsive, some of the
      general rules are to use % as unit over px, using rem as a unit of size
      for fonts. And the fact that you cannot manipulate width and height of
      most elements directly so therefore they must be covered in div tag first.
      Lately been improving my knowledge on nesting tag, displays, postioning
      etc.

      My portfolio has the best design because not only it uses mixture of
      multiple web-development languages but also because it uses bootstrap
      framework and those smooth animations looks so fluid. This website screams
      of professionalism. I also really like the font, how simple it is and how
      easy it is to manuver.
